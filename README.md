# grepcidr-win32
cygwin build of grepcidr - requires cygwin1.dll in the same folder or your path
 
A version of grepcidr 1.3 cmd line tool I built in cygwin back from 2009 so could run on Windows (tested on Win7 & Win10)

Sharing as I'm yet to find a win32 tool that does this.

Usage:
        grepcidr [-V] [-c] [-v] PATTERN [FILE]
        grepcidr [-V] [-c] [-v] [-e PATTERN | -f FILE] [FILE]
